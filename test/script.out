saxo: error: could not create the directory `/tmp/sax/.saxo`

directories in the process, failed. Check permissions on all parent directories
to make sure that we can write here. Also make sure that the parent path is a
directory.

saxo: error: the directory `/tmp/sax/.saxo` already exists

You tried to make a directory that already exists. This is usually caused by
saxo already existing through a previous creation command. It may also be
caused by a path conflict, for example if you thought that you needed to
manually create the saxo directory beforehand.

This script won't write new material into any existing directories in case of
data corruption.
